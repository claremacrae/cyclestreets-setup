# Script to change CycleStreets served routes
# Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (View Ubuntu version using 'lsb_release -a')
# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data
#
# Run as the cyclestreets user (a check is peformed after the config file is loaded).

# SYNOPSIS
#	run.sh newEdition
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	newEdition
#		Names a routing database of the form routingYYMMDD, eg. routing150404

# This file is only geared towards updating the locally served routes to a new edition.
# Pre-requisites:
# An existing routing service must already be running
# If a failOverServer is specified, it must already be serving routes for the new edition.

### Stage 1 - general setup

# Announce start
echo "#	$(date)	CycleStreets routing data switchover"

# Ensure this script is NOT run as root (it should be run as the cyclestreets user, having sudo rights as setup by install-website)
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
    echo "#	This script must NOT be run as root." 1>&2
    exit 1
fi

# Bomb out if something goes wrong
set -e

# Lock directory
lockdir=/var/lock/cyclestreets
mkdir -p $lockdir

# Set a lock file; see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7057234/bash-flock-exit-if-cant-acquire-lock/7057385
(
	flock -n 9 || { echo '#	A switchover is already running' ; exit 1; }

### CREDENTIALS ###

# Define the location of the credentials file; see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733
# A more advanced technique will be required if this file is called via a symlink.
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# Generate your own credentials file by copying from .config.sh.template
if [ ! -x ${configFile} ]; then

### Do switch-over

# Clear this cache - (whose rows relate to a specific routing edition)
${superMysql} cyclestreets -e "truncate map_nearestPointCache;";

if [ -n "${failoverRoutingServer}" ]; then

else

    # Set the journeyPlannerStatus to closed for the duration

fi

# Configure the routing engine to use the new edition
echo -e "#!/bin/bash\nBASEDIR=${websitesContentFolder}/data/routing/${newEdition}" > $routingEngineConfigFile

# Ensure it is executable
chmod a+x $routingEngineConfigFile

# Restart the routing service
# Rather than use the restart option to the service, it is stopped then started. This enables the script to verify that the service did stop properly in between.
# This seems to be necessary when there are large amounts of memory being freed by stopping.

# Stop the routing service (the cyclestreets user should have passwordless sudo access to this command)
sudo ${routingDaemonLocation} stop

# Check the local routing service has stopped
localRoutingStatus=$(${routingDaemonLocation} status | grep "State:")
echo "#	Initial status: ${localRoutingStatus}"

if [ "${locallyRunningEdition}" != "${newEdition}" ]; then
	echo "#	The local server is running: ${locallyRunningEdition} not the requested edition: ${newEdition}"

fi

# Switch the website to the local server and ensure the routingDb is also set
${superMysql} cyclestreets -e "UPDATE map_config SET routingDb = '${newEdition}', routeServerUrl = '${localRoutingServer}' WHERE id = 1;";

# Restore the journeyPlannerStatus
${superMysql} cyclestreets -e "UPDATE map_config SET journeyPlannerStatus = 'live' WHERE id = 1;";


### Finishing

# Tinkle the update - the account with userId = 2 is a general notification account so that message appears to come from CycleStreets
${superMysql} cyclestreets -e "insert tinkle (userId, tinkle) values (2, 'Routing data updated to ${importDate} YYMMDD, details: http://cycle.st/journey/help/osmconversion/');";

# Report
echo "#	$(date)	Completed switch to $newEdition"

# Remove the lock file - ${0##*/} extracts the script's basename
) 9>$lockdir/${0##*/}

# End of file
