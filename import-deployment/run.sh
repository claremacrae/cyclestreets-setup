# Script to deploy CycleStreets import system on Ubuntu
# Tested on 12.10 (View Ubuntu version using 'lsb_release -a')
# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data

# WIP - many parts of the import setup are yet to be completed in here
# e.g external libraries and databases setup (elevations, postcodes, railways etc)
# Permissions for the import user
# Some of that data cannot be included in this repo because it is owned by others.

# Ensure this script is run as root

### CREDENTIALS ###

# Get the script directory see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733
# The second single line solution from that page is probably good enough as it is unlikely that this script itself will be symlinked.
DIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# Use this to remove the ../
ScriptHome=$(readlink -f "${DIR}/..")

# Name of the credentials file
configFile=${ScriptHome}/.config.sh

# Generate your own credentials file by copying from .config.sh.template
if [ ! -x ${configFile} ]; then
    echo "#	The config file, ${configFile}, does not exist or is not executable - copy your own based on the ${configFile}.template file." 1>&2
    exit 1
fi

# Load the credentials
. ${configFile}

# Load helper functions
. ${ScriptHome}/utility/helper.sh

# Main body of script

# Install the website
# !! Turned off for testing
# !! Import machine may also need different config options for the server - needs checking
#. ../install-website/run.sh

# Cron jobs
if $installCronJobs ; then

    # Update scripts
    jobs[1]="25 6 * * * cd ${ScriptHome} && git pull -q"
