#	This file is one of the cyclestreets backup tasks that runs on the backup machine.
#
#	This file downloads dumps from dev.cyclestreets.net to the backup machine.
#
#	The server should generate backups of
#	* subversion repository
#	* trac
#	as zipped files.
#	Both files should also have .md5 files containing the md5 strings associated with them.
#	This script looks at the remote md5 files to determine whether they and the dumps are ready to download.

# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data.

# When in failover mode uncomment the next two lines:
#echo "# Skipping in failover mode"
#exit 1

### Stage 1 - general setup

# Ensure this script is NOT run as root (it should be run as cyclestreets)
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
    echo "#	This script must NOT be run as root." 1>&2
    exit 1

# Bomb out if something goes wrong

# Lock directory
lockdir=/var/lock/cyclestreets
mkdir -p $lockdir

# Set a lock file; see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7057234/bash-flock-exit-if-cant-acquire-lock/7057385
(
	flock -n 9 || { echo 'CycleStreets Dev Download is already running' ; exit 1; }
