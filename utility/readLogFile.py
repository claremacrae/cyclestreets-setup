# A helper script for generating journey planner performance data for munin.
#
# This script fetches the last few lines of an Apache access log that contains
# server response times in microseconds at the end of each line.
# It filters for the journey calls and calculates the average response rate in milliseconds.
#
# Synopsis
#	readLogFile.py logFile
#
# Result
#	Average response rate in milisconds of the journey planner access log lines.


# Dependencies
import subprocess, re, sys

# Trace
# print "#\tStarting"

# Log file
# logfile = "/websites/www/logs/veebee-access.log"

# Read args supplied to script

# Number of lines

# Api call pattern
apiCall = 'api/journey.json'

# Get the last few lines of the log file

# Read the data

# Number of matching lines

# Total time

# Scan
while line:

    # Trace
    #print line

    # Check if the line contains call to the journey api

        match = re.match('.*?([0-9]+)$', line)
        if match:

# Time in millisconds

# Calculate the average
if count > 0:
    # float()  ensures the / avoids truncating
    milliSeconds = round(float(microSeconds) / (count * 1000))
