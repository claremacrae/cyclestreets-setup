# Script to install CycleStreets routing data on Ubuntu
# Tested on 12.10 (View Ubuntu version using 'lsb_release -a')
# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data



### Stage 1 - general setup

echo "#	CycleStreets routing data installation switching"

# Ensure this script is run as root
if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then
    echo "#	This script must be run as root." 1>&2
    exit 1
fi

# Bomb out if something goes wrong
set -e

# Set a lock file; see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7057234/bash-flock-exit-if-cant-acquire-lock/7057385
(
	flock -n 9 || { echo 'An installation is already running' ; exit 1; }


### CREDENTIALS ###

# Define the location of the credentials file; see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733
configFile=../.config.sh
SCRIPTDIRECTORY="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# Generate your own credentials file by copying from .config.sh.template
if [ ! -e $SCRIPTDIRECTORY/${configFile} ]; then
    echo "# The config file, ${configFile}, does not exist - copy your own based on the ${configFile}.template file." 1>&2
    exit 1
fi

# Load the credentials
. $SCRIPTDIRECTORY/${configFile}

# Logging
# Use an absolute path for the log file to be tolerant of the changing working directory in this script

echo "#	CycleStreets routing data switchover in progress, follow log file with: tail -f ${setupLogFile}"
