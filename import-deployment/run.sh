# Script to deploy CycleStreets import system on Ubuntu
# Tested on 12.10 (View Ubuntu version using 'lsb_release -a')
# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data

# WIP - many parts of the import setup are yet to be completed in here
# e.g external libraries and databases setup (elevations, postcodes, railways etc)
# Permissions for the import user
# Some of that data cannot be included in this repo because it is owned by others.

### CREDENTIALS ###

# Get the script directory see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733
# The second single line solution from that page is probably good enough as it is unlikely that this script itself will be symlinked.

# * Handle very large tables
