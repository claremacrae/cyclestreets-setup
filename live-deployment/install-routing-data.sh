# Script to install CycleStreets routing data
# Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 (View Ubuntu version using 'lsb_release -a')
# This script is idempotent - it can be safely re-run without destroying existing data
#
# Run as the cyclestreets user (a check is peformed after the config file is loaded).

# Requires password-less access to the import machine, using a public key.

# When in failover mode uncomment the next two lines:
#echo "# Skipping in failover mode"
#exit 1

### Stage 1 - general setup

# Avoid echo if possible as this generates cron emails
# echo "#	CycleStreets routing data installation $(date)"

# Ensure this script is NOT run as root (it should be run as the cyclestreets user, having sudo rights as setup by install-website)
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
    echo "#	This script must NOT be run as root." 1>&2
    exit 1
fi

# Bomb out if something goes wrong
set -e

# Lock directory
lockdir=/var/lock/cyclestreets
mkdir -p $lockdir

# Set a lock file; see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7057234/bash-flock-exit-if-cant-acquire-lock/7057385

	flock -n 9 || { echo '#	An installation is already running' ; exit 1; }


### CREDENTIALS ###

# Get the script directory see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733

### Stage 3 - get the routing files and check data integrity

# Begin the file transfer
echo "#	$(date)	Transferring the routing files from the import machine ${importMachineAddress}"

# Create the folder
mkdir -p ${newEditionFolder}

# Move the temporary definition to correct place and name
mv ${newImportDefinition} ${newEditionFolder}/importdefinition.ini

#	Transfer the TSV file
scp ${username}@${importMachineAddress}:${importMachineEditions}/${importEdition}/tsv.tar.gz ${newEditionFolder}/

#	Hot-copied tables file
scp ${username}@${importMachineAddress}:${importMachineEditions}/${importEdition}/tables.tar.gz ${newEditionFolder}/

#	Sieve file
scp ${username}@${importMachineAddress}:${importMachineEditions}/${importEdition}/sieve.sql ${newEditionFolder}/

#	Note that all files are downloaded
echo "#	$(date)	File transfer stage complete"

# MD5 checks

	exit 1
fi


### Stage 4 - unpack and install the TSV files
cd ${newEditionFolder}
tar xf tsv.tar.gz

#	Clean up the compressed TSV data
rm tsv.tar.gz

### Stage 5 - create the routing database

# Narrate
echo "#	$(date)	Installing the routing database: ${importEdition}"

#	Create the database (which will be empty for now) and set default collation
mysqladmin create ${importEdition} -hlocalhost --default-character-set=utf8

dbFilesLocation=/var/lib/mysql/

# Requires root permissions to check this and so sudo is used.

   echo "#	$(date) !! The MySQL database does not seem to be installed in the expected location."
   exit 1
fi

# Unpack the database files, preserve permissions, verbose into mysql
echo $password | sudo -S tar xpvf tables.tar.gz -C ${dbFilesLocation}${importEdition}

# Remove the zip
rm tables.tar.gz

### Stage 6 - run post-install stored procedures

#	Load nearest point stored procedures
echo "#	$(date)	Loading nearestPoint technology"
mysql ${importEdition} -hlocalhost < ${websitesContentFolder}/documentation/schema/nearestPoint.sql

# Build the photo index
echo "#	$(date)	Building the photosEnRoute tables"
mysql ${importEdition} -hlocalhost < ${websitesContentFolder}/documentation/schema/photosEnRoute.sql
mysql ${importEdition} -hlocalhost -e "call indexPhotos(false,0);"

### Stage 7 - Finish

# Create a file that indicates the end of the script was reached - this can be tested for by the switching script
touch "${websitesContentFolder}/data/routing/${importEdition}/installationCompleted.txt"

# Report completion and next steps
echo "#	$(date) Installation completed, to switch routing service use: ./switch-routing-edition.sh ${importEdition}"

# Remove the lock file - ${0##*/} extracts the script's basename
) 9>$lockdir/${0##*/}

# End of file
