==================

Scripts for installing CycleStreets

After the repository has been cloned from github, proceed by making your own *.config.sh* file based on the *.config.sh.template* file.

The *root* user is required to install the packages, but most of the installation is done as the *cyclestreets* user (using *sudo*).
