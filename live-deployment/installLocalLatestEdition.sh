# SYNOPSIS
#	installLocalLatestEdition.sh
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	Used on a server that provides both the live and import deployments. Ie. usually a developer machine.
#	This script moves the files generated by the latest import run to the website data area so they can be used for routing.
#	Afterwards use ./switchRoutingEdition.sh to use the new edition.
#
# Run as the cyclestreets user (a check is peformed after the config file is loaded).

echo "# $(date)	Install latest locally generated CycleStreets import routing edition"

# Ensure this script is NOT run as root
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
    echo "#	This script must not be be run as root." 1>&2
    exit 1

# Bomb out if something goes wrong

# Lock directory

### CREDENTIALS ###

# Get the script directory see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/180733
# The second single line solution from that page is probably good enough as it is unlikely that this script itself will be symlinked.
DIR="$( cd -P "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"

# Use this to remove the ../
ScriptHome=$(readlink -f "${DIR}/..")

# Name of the credentials file
configFile=${ScriptHome}/.config.sh

# Generate your own credentials file by copying from .config.sh.template

## Main body of script

# Configure MySQL for routing

# Setting these parameters here will have the effect of reducing them from their import settings, at least until the next MySQL restart, when they will inherit the configuration values.
